# mediumbot

## Purpose

The crypto space is often to fast to keep track of. Never miss the start of a cool farming opportunity or the genesis group of a new project again! 
Most projects host their blog at [medium](https://medium.com/.com/), so this bot scrapes through the blog posts, filters them for interesting opportunities and sends the results to a telegram group.

## Configuration

The parameters for the scraping are found in scraping_config:
* **daysSincePublishing:** Scrapes articles from these many days ago
* **tags:** Only articles with these tags are searched
* **keywords:** For all articles within the tags, only articles containing at least one of these keywords are recorded
* **blacklist:** If there are obvious scam-projects or article spammers, project containing these keywords will not be recorded
* **likeThreshold:** To filter for projects with certain traction, projects with at least this many likes are displayed at the top of the telegram message

The parameters for the telegram bot should be saved in a separate private file in the root folder since especially the bot token should not be shared. The file should have the following format:
```json
{
    "BOT_TOKEN": "telegramBotToken",
    "CHAT_ID": "telegramChatId"
}
```
